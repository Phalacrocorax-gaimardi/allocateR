Description: The current version of allocateR uses CEDS emissions dataset for more than 200 countries, 20 country groupings including shipping and aviation.
    Country groupings are based (loosely) on a unique assignment to UNFCCC negotiating groups extend to include shipping and aviation and "other" as additaion groups. UNFCCC groups
    include G77, EU27, Umbrella Group, BASIC, SIDS, Least Developed Countries etc. Where a country is a member of multiple groups, it is assigned to the smallest
    group of which it is a member. GSAT contributions are computed using the Hector Simple Climate Model and brute-force evaluation Shapley allocation from cooperative game theory.
